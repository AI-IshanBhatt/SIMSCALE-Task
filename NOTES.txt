Don't read files in  multi-threaded way, that is the worst use case of concurrency.
Reading in parallel from a spinning disk is never a good idea.
As, the mechenical head will keep on bouncing when context switch happens. and slows down the things

Rather process the chunks you have read on multiple threads using executor service
